## Technical Details

### HNSW Implementation

```python
class HNSW:
    def __init__(self, dimension, max_elements, M=16, ef_construction=200, ef=10):
        # M: Maximum number of connections per element per layer
        # ef_construction: Size of dynamic candidate list during construction
        # ef: Size of dynamic candidate list during search
```

1. **Graph Construction**
   - Multi-layer graph structure
   - Layer count: log(N) * ml where ml = 1/ln(M)
   - Each element connects to M nearest neighbors
   - Bottom layer has 2*M connections for better recall

2. **Search Algorithm**
   - Greedy search with backtracking
   - Layer-wise traversal from top to bottom
   - Dynamic candidate list size (ef parameter)
   - Distance calculations optimized with NumPy

3. **Vector Storage**
   - Custom VectorData class with efficient serialization
   - MinIO for binary vector storage
   - Redis for graph structure and metadata
   - Connection pooling for better performance

### API Endpoints

1. **Vector Operations**
   ```
   POST /vectors/
   {
     "id": int,
     "vector": List[float],
     "dimension": int
   }
   
   POST /search/
   {
     "vector": List[float],
     "dimension": int,
     "k": int
   }
   ```

2. **Index Management**
   ```
   POST /clear
   POST /clear/{dimension}
   GET /health
   ```

## Deployment
